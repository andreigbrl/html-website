        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Hearthstone is a turn-based card game between two opponents who use constructed decks of 30 cards along with a selected hero with a unique power.By winning matches or completing quests, players can earn gold which can be used to buy packs to improve their card collection. Players use a limited resource, called mana crystals to play spells or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal of destroying the opponent's hero.</p>
        <p>Mana increases by one each turn with a maximum of ten, and with cards having various mana costs. This requires strategy as the player must plan ahead, taking into account what cards can and cannot be played.</p>
        <p>There are five different types of cards: minions, spells, weapons, hero cards and locations. These cards are divided into rarity groups, with Legendary cards being the rarest, followed by Epic, Rare, and Common.</p>

        <h2>Game modes</h2>
        <p>The game modes available in Hearthstone are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional Hearthstone, which has the following variants:
                <ul>

                    <li>Wild, which uses all the cards ever released;</li>
                    <li>Classic, which uses a mirror of the player's library of all cards that were in the game as of the June 2014 release of the game, reverting any updates or changes to these cards in the interim, effectively representing the game's start at the time of its release;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Arena has the player draft a deck of thirty cards from choices of three cards. Players use this deck against other Arena opponents until they win 12 matches or lose 3 in a row, after which the deck is retired and players are rewarded in-game based on their performance.</li>
            <li>Tavern Brawl is a challenge that changes weekly and may impose unusual deck-building guidelines;</li>
            <li>Duels is a multiplayer version of Hearthstone's singleplayer "Dungeon Run" game mode;</li>
            <li>Solo Adventures are single-player battles against an opponent controlled by an AI;</li>
            <li>Battlegrounds is based on the auto battler genre, allowing eight players to compete in each match by recruiting minions over several rounds;</li>
            <li>Mercenaries uses a party-based combat system with roguelike mechanics. A player creates a party from six minions from a central Minion Village and uses that party to complete various quests, both as player-versus-environment and player-versus-player.</li>
